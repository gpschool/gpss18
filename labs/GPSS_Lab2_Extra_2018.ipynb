Typically in Python, this operator is the exponent operator, but for `GPy` kernels, we use it to indicate a tensor product. Linear models of coregionalisation are based on combining a matrix with a standard covariance function, or kernel. We think of this matrix as a paritcular _type_ of covariance function, whose elements are referenced using the indices denoting the particular events (e.g. $0$ is \"_Women's 100 m_\", etc.) Using this setup, we want to build a covariance matrix where the first column of the input features (in this case, the event year) is passed to a covariance function for regression, and the second column (the event labels) are passed to the coregionalisation matrix.\n",
