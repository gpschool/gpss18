    "\n",
    "This lab is designed to introduce Gaussian processes in a practical way, illustrating the concepts introduced in the first two lectures. The key aspects of Gaussian process regression are covered: the covariance function (aka kernels); sampling a Gaussian process; and the regression model. The notebook will introduce the Python library `GPy`$^\\dagger$ which handles the kernels, regression and optimisation of hyperparameter, allowing us to easily access the results we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "The level of this notebook is aimed at introductory, as the background of attendees is diverse, and so cover a wide range of basic GP concepts. There are seven exercises to complete, the difficulty of which varies, but you should aim to complete all during the lab session. The notebook will not be marked and we will provide answers to the exercises after the lab session.\n",

    "In addition, there is a second _optional_ notebook with extra work. The content of this is more advanced, so completion is at your discretion.\n",

    "Using Gaussian processes for machine learning gives you a powerful tool for learning latent functions in a Bayesian fashion, especially with a low number of observations. However, full GP regression can be quite time consuming, given it scales $\\mathscr{O}(n^3)$ with the number of training points, $n$. There are methods for dealing with this: for example, sparse approximation or representing the regression problem as a state-space model. Each of these comes with their own assumptions and drawbacks. In tomorrow's session, there will be a lecture on computational efficiency in GPs and the next lab will have examples of some of these approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using GPs in a computational setting, there are a wide range of tools that can be used depending on your preference of programming language and libraries. `GPy`, the library we use in these labs, is a well established Python library that was developed here at the University of Sheffield, and is maintained by members here and at Amazon Research Cambridge. Some other libraries that are commonly used for Gaussian processes include:\n",
