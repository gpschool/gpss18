    "The non-parametric formulation that characterises Gaussian processes makes the cost of inference prohibitive when the number of data observations is large. The computational cost of inference is $\\mathscr{O}(N^3)$, where $N$ is the number of observations, for full GP regression, as a result of matrix inversions required to calculate the posterior. In order to deal with this, an augmentation of the GP regression model called _sparse GPs_ aims to use a small set of _inducing variables_ to approximate the probability space. The driving idea is to find a posterior over the smaller set of $M (\\ll N)$ inducing variables instead of over $N$ training points to reduce the computational requirements. The challenge, then, is to find the set of inducing variables and model parameters that best approximate the full GP.\n",

A recent extension, particularly for classification of large data sets with GPs is using _stochastic variational inference_ for sparse GPs$^1$.\n",
